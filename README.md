# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Movies Dataset
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Movies Dataset. You can also find an in-depth report (Movies_EDA.odt) and the dataset itself (movies.csv). I completed this project as one of the compulsory tasks during my Data Science BootCamp, and this will provide you with valuable insights and visualizations about the dataset's contents.

Clone this repository to your local machine and explore the EDA.

# Tools used
